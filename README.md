# Minecraft Bedrock Add-Ons

A growing collection of self-contained Bedrock packs I build for fun experiments and night-time encounters. Each add-on lives in its own folder with its own `README` so you can explore, remix, or drop it into a world without touching the others.

## What's inside

| Add-on | Folder | Snapshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Night Courier | `night-courier/` | Adds a roaming nocturnal courier mob with edible token drops and starter behavior/resource packs. |

## How to use this repo

1. Pick an add-on folder and read its README for the full install guide, identifiers, and roadmap.
2. Copy the behavior/resource packs into your Bedrock `com.mojang` directories (or the development variants) just like any other pack.
3. Repeat for additional folders as new add-ons appear—each one is intentionally siloed.

## Contributing / extending

- New add-on idea? Create a sibling folder, scaffold the usual `behavior_pack` and `resource_pack`, and document it with the same structure.
- Keep UUIDs unique per pack. Use the dependency block so linked packs stay paired.
- Feel free to open issues or PRs for bugs, balancing, or spare art/audio you want to donate.

Stay tuned—more mobs, utilities, and spooky deliveries will land here as they come together.
